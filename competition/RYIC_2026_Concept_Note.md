## Project Title

**YCD Farmer Guide** – AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Smallholder Farmers in Cameroon

---

## 1. Executive Summary

YCD Farmer Guide is an innovative mobile application designed to empower smallholder farmers in Cameroon with AI-driven agricultural support, real-time market access, and expert advisory services. The platform addresses critical challenges facing over 70% of Cameroon's rural population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods but lack access to modern farming knowledge, fair market prices, and timely expert guidance.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in Cameroon face interconnected challenges that limit their productivity and income:

| Challenge                  | Impact                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crop Disease Losses**    | Farmers lose 20-40% of crops annually due to undiagnosed plant diseases and delayed treatment              |
| **Market Information Gap** | Lack of price transparency leads to exploitation by middlemen, reducing farmer income by up to 50%         |
| **Limited Expert Access**  | Agricultural extension officers cover 1:3,000+ farmer ratio, making personalized advice nearly impossible  |
| **Climate Vulnerability**  | Unpredictable weather patterns destroy crops; farmers lack access to localized forecasts                   |
| **Knowledge Silos**        | Traditional farming knowledge is not adapted to changing conditions; modern techniques remain inaccessible |

**The Result:** Low agricultural productivity, persistent rural poverty, and food insecurity affecting millions.
