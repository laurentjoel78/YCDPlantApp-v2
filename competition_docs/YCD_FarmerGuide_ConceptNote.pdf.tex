\end{center}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{1. Executive Summary}

YCD Farmer Guide is an innovative mobile application designed to empower smallholder farmers in Cameroon with AI-driven agricultural support, real-time market access, and expert advisory services. The platform addresses critical challenges facing over 70\% of Cameroon's rural population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods but lack access to modern farming knowledge, fair market prices, and timely expert guidance.

\textbf{2. Problem Statement}

Smallholder farmers in Cameroon face interconnected challenges that limit their productivity and income:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item \textbf{Crop Disease Losses:} Farmers lose 20--40\% of crops annually due to undiagnosed plant diseases and delayed treatment.
  \item \textbf{Market Information Gap:} Lack of price transparency leads to exploitation by middlemen, reducing farmer income by up to 50\%.
  \item \textbf{Limited Expert Access:} Agricultural extension officers cover 1:3,000+ farmer ratio, making personalized advice nearly impossible.
  \item \textbf{Climate Vulnerability:} Unpredictable weather patterns destroy crops; farmers lack access to localized forecasts.
  \item \textbf{Knowledge Silos:} Traditional farming knowledge is not adapted to changing conditions; modern techniques remain inaccessible.
\end{itemize}

\textit{The result: Low agricultural productivity, persistent rural poverty, and food insecurity affecting millions.}

\textbf{3. Proposed Solution}

YCD Farmer Guide is a comprehensive mobile platform that brings together:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item \textbf{AI-Powered Disease Detection:} Farmers photograph sick plants; AI instantly identifies diseases with 90\%+ accuracy and provides treatment recommendations in English and French.
  \item \textbf{Agricultural Marketplace:} Direct farmer-to-buyer connections, real-time pricing, and secure mobile payment integration.
  \item \textbf{Expert Advisory Network:} On-demand chat/video consultations with agricultural experts and appointment booking with verified agronomists.
  \item \textbf{Community Forums:} Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and support among farmers nationwide.
  \item \textbf{Weather Forecasts:} Hyperlocal, actionable weather information for better planning.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Impact}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item Reach: 50,000+ farmers in 10 regions
  \item Crop loss reduction: 30\%
  \item Income increase: up to 2x for participating farmers
  \item Alignment with SDGs: No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Decent Work, Innovation
\end{itemize}
