## Project Title

**YCD Farmer Guide** – AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Smallholder Farmers in Cameroon

---

## 1. Executive Summary

YCD Farmer Guide is an innovative mobile application designed to empower smallholder farmers in Cameroon with AI-driven agricultural support, real-time market access, and expert advisory services. The platform addresses critical challenges facing over 70% of Cameroon's rural population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods but lack access to modern farming knowledge, fair market prices, and timely expert guidance.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in Cameroon face interconnected challenges that limit their productivity and income:

- **Crop Disease Losses:** Farmers lose 20–40% of crops annually due to undiagnosed plant diseases and delayed treatment.
- **Market Information Gap:** Lack of price transparency leads to exploitation by middlemen, reducing farmer income by up to 50%.
- **Limited Expert Access:** Agricultural extension officers cover 1:3,000+ farmer ratio, making personalized advice nearly impossible.
- **Climate Vulnerability:** Unpredictable weather patterns destroy crops; farmers lack access to localized forecasts.
- **Knowledge Silos:** Traditional farming knowledge is not adapted to changing conditions; modern techniques remain inaccessible.

_The result: Low agricultural productivity, persistent rural poverty, and food insecurity affecting millions._
